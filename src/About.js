        Welcome to our Social Media App! As a frontend developer, I created this
        app to provide a simple, user-friendly platform for sharing posts. The
        key features include the ability to easily add, edit, and delete posts,
        giving you full control over your content. This app uses localStorage to
        store your data, ensuring all your posts are saved within your browser,
        even when you refresh or revisit the page. Enjoy exploring, and feel
        free to create, edit, and delete posts to make the experience truly your
        own!
